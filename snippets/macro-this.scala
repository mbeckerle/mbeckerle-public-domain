   * Used to temporarily vary the bit length limit.
   *
   * Implementing as a macro eliminates the creation of a downward function object every time this
   * is called.
   *
   * ISSUE: this macro really wants to use a self reference to `this`. But when a macro is expanded
   * the object that `this` represents changes. Until a better way to do this comes about, we have to pass
   * the `this` object to the `self` argument, which makes calls look like:
   *     dis.withBigLengthLimit(dis, newLimit){... body ...}
   * That looks redundant, and it is, but it's more important to get the allocation of this downward function
   * object out of inner loops.
